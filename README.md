# Laser-Based-Communication-System
Transfer of text and audio will be done using laser lights

We will transfer text and audio in different frequencies. 
Laser lights are used as Transmitters and solar panels are used to receive the signal from lasers. 
By enabling the light based communication in daily life, we can reduce the radio frequencies harm in our surroundings with this LI-FI communication the both light and data transfer will be happen at the same time
